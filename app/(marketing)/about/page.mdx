# About Word Rush: Where Words Come Alive!

## Our Story

Once upon a time, in a parallel universe where dictionaries had secret parties, Word Rush was born. 🎉

**Why "Word Rush"?** Because we believe that words are like caffeinated squirrels—they're always in a hurry to escape our minds and leap onto the page! 🐿️💨

## The Word Rush Game

### How It Works

1. **Word Drops:** Every hour, we release words into the wild. They parachute down from the cloud dictionary. 🪂
2. **Hunt Mode:** Your mission? Spot those words faster than a caffeinated squirrel chasing an acorn! 🌟
3. **Points Galore:** First to find a word gets 13 points. Others get 3 points. Even failed hunters get 1 point. Because hey, effort counts! 💪

## Referral Rumble

### Invite Friends, Win Big

💌 **Referral Code:** Share it with friends. The more they play, the more points you earn. It's like a wordy pyramid scheme, but legal! 🗣️💰

## Token Tidbits
